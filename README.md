### Main
Roblox-Similar-Group-Scraper is a tool designed to help users efficiently find similar groups

It works this way:
1. Input one or more 'root' groups.
2. Gets a list of all players within these groups
3. Gets a list of all groups each of these players is in
4. Ranks each 'child' group based on the ammount of players from the 'root' group who occured within them
5. Saves the result to a file

### Main
Roblox-Similar-Group-Scraper is a tool designed to help users efficiently find Roblox groups related to each other

It works this way:
1. Input one or more 'root' groups.
2. Gets a list of all players within these groups
3. Gets a list of all groups each of these players is in
4. Ranks each 'child' group based on the ammount of players from the 'root' group who occured within them
5. Saves the result to a file

### Usage:
1. Clone/download the repository source code (click the green "Code" button and click "Download Zip"
2. Run the "main.py" file and use the GUI
Note: There aren't any dependencies to install. The program should run with out-of-the-box "vanilla" Python

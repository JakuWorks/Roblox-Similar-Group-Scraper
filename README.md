## Backstory
Originally this scipt was created with the purpose of FINDING and BANNING the illegal erp groups in Roblox. Thus it was called "Roblox-ERP-Scraper".
However now in 2024, I've realized that this program may have other useful implementations too, thus I renamed it to "Roblox-Similar-Group-Scraper" to better reflect it's capabilities.

### Main
Roblox ERP Scraper is a tool designed to help Roblox moderators efficiently find and BAN ERP groups.
It has been created in good faith

It works like this:
1. Input one or more 'root' groups.
2. Gets a list of all players within these groups
3. Gets a list of all groups each of these players is in
4. Ranks each 'child' group based on the ammount of players from the 'root' group who occured within them
5. Saves the result to a file

Why this works?
Most of rule-breaking players create so-called 'alternative accounts'. 
These alt accounts are used for all the rule breaking while their 'main' account remains pure and cannot be banned.
Therefore these creeps don't worry being discrete and join as many erp groups as they can with their alt accounts creating a large web.
